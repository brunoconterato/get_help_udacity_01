Hello, need help to run locally the eod-quotemedia.

Try the historical_variance to see what I did.

The notebook.tar.gz is the copy of the notebook from udacity, obtained using this commands:
- Copy the m4-quiz-eod-quotemedia
$ import shutil   
$ shutil.copytree('../../data/', '/home/workspace/data')

- Get the tar.gz file (To download the files to my local machine)
$ !tar chvfz notebook.tar.gz *

Thank You!
